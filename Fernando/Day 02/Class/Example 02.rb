puts "System error"
puts "Kernel panic : #{10%2+5-4}"

puts "the sum of 5+5 results in #{5+5} and gives a line jump when beginning with PUTS"
print "#{5+5}"" is the result for the same mathematic operation before, but this time coded without" 

#1. Take your previous script and change calculations for variables

num1 = 2+2
num2 = 3+3

puts "Result for 4 plus 6 is: #{num1 + num2}"

numKP = 10%2+5-4
print "Grabbing Kernel Panic error with the variable numKP> #{numKP} "

#2. Add some line in the middle of your script that is referring to a variable that doesn't exist. Run the file and explain the error displayed.
#print a variable but without declaring it.
print "#{a}"


#3. Create a new script adding at least one case for each one of the arithmetic, comparison, assignment and logical operators, print them
#and also print the result obtained.
