1 What is ruby?
Ruby is a easy programming language which is dynamic, was developed
aproximately 20 years ago but it was more used by Testers later because its
simplicity to perform tasks.

2 What pros/cons you considered from the point explained in the class
Pros:
Easy to learn, we don't have to "reinvent the wheel".
Cons:
Not to many documentation about what ruby exactly is and how it really works.

3 According what we talked today, what are the 3 testing tiers?
I could consider UI testing first because it's the area where you interact
first as a tester/user, after that the Services are more related to increase 
security and escalability to the software when adding processes or methods to be
consumed by their http methods. And the Backend wich is mostly the DataBase.
